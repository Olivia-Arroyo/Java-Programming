# Java Recursion
This project utilized recursion to complete the following:

1.	Reverse Method -Write a short recursive Java method that takes a character string s and outputs its reverse. For example, the reverse of 'pots&pans' would be 'snap&stop'.

2.	Value sorting- Write a short recursive Java method that rearranges an array of integer values so that all the even values appear before all the odd values.
(Sample input: [43,10,26,18,7,9,68,43,12,56,57,24])
